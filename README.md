Most of this code pulled from: https://github.com/ankonzoid/LearningX/blob/master/classical_RL/MAB

I edited some of the logging and made it more general purpose.

The purpose of this github is not so much to host the code as it is to host the output and knowledge that can be gained from running the code. Credit to Anson Wong for most of it. I'm just running it and storing my results.
